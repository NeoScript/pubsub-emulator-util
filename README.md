# Pub/Sub Emulator CLI

This is a minimal CLI created to help with common tasks
that are done in the pubsub emulator.

The main intended use is to provide initial startup
functionality to the [pubsub emulator](https://github.com/neoscript/pubsub-emulator-lite).

Other options already exist, I just wanted an excuse to make something in Rust 😂
